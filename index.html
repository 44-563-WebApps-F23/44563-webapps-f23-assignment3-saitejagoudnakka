    <h2>My favorite vacation spot is AdhiYogi</h2>
    <p>If i got a chance to spend rest of my life at one place, one of that place will be AdhiYogi in TaminNadu. 
    <strong>In my view It is the spiritual hub of TaminNadu</strong>and the <strong>AdhiYogi statue is one 
    of the amazing thing you can see at that place</strong>.The thick jungle which covers the entire area and 
    the presence of wild life is simply amazing. </p>
